<!-- ## Ensuring digital technology can serve the underserved through lived experience and understanding overlooked needs in their environment -->

# Have you ever tried not being you?

Technology promises us a huge amount. Better accessibility, greater participation, and fewer disabling barriers. Yet, many products fail to live up to this. Uninformed by lived experience, they fail to understand the real problem. At best, they are a distraction, and at worst they can be actively harmful. When you get to the root of it, the solution being offered is “stop being you”.

In this roundtable talk, Marc Goblot and Matthew Bellringer will be discussing:

How Self Determination can help us understand where technology can best support neurodivergent and disabled people, where it fails, and how we can address that. 
How it’s vital that the tools we create support autonomy, competence, and connectedness.
What design approaches are they using to support Self Determination in their own work.

If you’re interested in accessibility, adaptive design, and building technology that makes the world a better place, then please have a look.
